Quiz Question (1 pt)
The TAs will choose one of the following questions during the grading session. Please be
prepared to give a one-minute answer with your partner.
1. What is one use of the surface normal for a bounce in a ray tracing algorithm?
2. What natural phenomena require recursive ray tracing to render? Can you describe
the process that is used to make sure rays aren’t infinitely generated/traced?
3. Ray tracing is inherently time-consuming compared to other strategies like scanline
rendering. Describe a strategy that is used to make ray tracing quicker.
4. How does ray tracer render shadows?
5. What is the difference between ambient and diffuse shading? Describe both
algorithmic and visual differences.
6. Explain the problem of spurious self-occlusion and how it can be solved.
7. Why can metals reflect the color of surrounding objects and the environment from all
viewing angles, but plastics cannot? Think about conductor and dielectrics material.
8. Explain Snell’s Law. Under what circumstances will total reflection occur?
