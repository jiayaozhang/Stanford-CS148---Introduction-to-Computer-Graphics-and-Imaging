# Quiz Question (1 pt)

The TAs will choose one of the following questions during the grading session. Please be prepared to give a one-minute answer with your partner.

1. How does light interact differently with different objects in real life? Give 3 examples. 

Light/electromagnetic radiation travels in a straight line and can do a couple of things when it hits an object. If we think about a specific wavelength of light as it interacts with an object, it can be:

* Reflected (reflection) – electromagnetic radiation/light bounces off the surface of the object. In order to see an object that doesn’t make it’s own light like the sun, light needs to bounce off the object and reach our eyes.

* Absorbed (absorption) – energy from the electromagnetic radiation/light is taken up/‘soaked up’ by the object (provide Ex.) Whether light is absorbed depends on the wavelength of light and atoms that the object is made up of. Different atoms or molecules have specific vibrational frequencies and when the vibrational frequency of the molecule matches the wavelength of light that hits it, the light gets absorbed.

* Transmitted (transmission) – when the light moves through the object.

* Diffracted (diffraction) – the spreading/bending of light as it goes through openings or around the edges of objects. The spreading of electromagnetic radiation looks a lot like the ripples you make in water when you dip your toe in. If the wavelength of the electromagnetic radiation is much smaller than the object around which is bends or opening it is going through, then very little to no diffraction is observed.

* Refracted (refraction) – the bending of transmitted light as it travels across the boundary of one material into another material in which it’s speed is different. Unlike diffraction, this change in direction of light occurs because light is changing its speed in the different substances in it traveling in. The refractive index of a material is a number that describes how light will travel in it compared to how it travels in air or in a vacuum. The higher the refractive index of a substance, the slower light travels.

2. Why do objects appear to have different colors to our eyes?

Sunlight reaches our atmosphere is composed of all the colors of the rainbow. The different wavelengths of light are scattered differently by particles in the air. Smaller wavelengths scatter more than longer wavelengths.

3. What's the advantage of using YUV color space?

YUV color-spaces are a more efficient coding and reduce the bandwidth more than RGB capture can. Most video cards, therefore, render directly using YUV or luminance/chrominance images. The most important component for YUV capture is always the luminance, or Y component.

4. How are colors added differently for lights compared to paint? What does R+G+B equal to in each case?

The primary colors of light are the secondary colors of pigments. Mixing a given color pair together will bring different results in light and pigment. Adding more colors to the mix will sully or darken the color in paint, but will appear paler and brighter in light.

5. Why do we choose green instead of other colors for chroma keying? Hint: There are a number of practical reasons but one of the reasons comes from how camera sensors interact with green light differently. Think about the arrangement of color filters in front of the camera sensor.

The reason the piece of video production equipment responsible for replacing the green in a green screen is called a chroma keyer is because it looks at the chrominance. It locates pixels founded on the green side of the color circle.

6. Why is tone mapping needed for HDR images?

Tone mapping is a digital image processing technique used to modify the tonal values of pixels. Tone mapping consists if adjusting the tonal values of an image with a high dynamic range so that it can be viewed on digital displays.

Local operator

The local operators take note of the localization of each pixel in the image and process them accordingly. In other words, this method calculates the adaptation of the luminance for each pixel of the image according to its position. The image produced becomes more accessible to the human eye and has more details, but the processing time can be longer.

Global operator

In contrast, global operators map each pixel according to their global characteristics, independently of their localization. This method calculates a single matching luminance for the entire image. The processing is therefore faster, but the image produced will have less details.
