# HW 6. Advanced Rendering

The TAs will choose one of the following questions during the grading session. Please
be prepared to give a one-minute answer with your partner.
1. Why is light tracing inefficient?
2. Explain the process of bidirectional ray tracing. What two types of tracing is it a
combination of?
3. In Iterative Radiosity, why might “Sorting and Shooting” converge to an acceptable
solution faster than randomly choosing the order in which surfaces distribute light?
4. What is albedo? How is it computed when the BRDF is diffuse?
5. What’s the difference between direct illumination and global illumination?
6. Can you explain how a light map is used and why it can be helpful in rendering
scenes? What are some advantages and disadvantages?
7. How does Monte Carlo Integration compare with Newton-Cotes quadrature? Why do
we not use Monte Carlo for low dimension problems? (Hint: think in terms of
dimensionality and accuracy)
8. How can Photon Mapping render different colors?
