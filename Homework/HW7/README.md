# HW 7. Geometry Modeling

1. What is the loop subdivision, and how does it work?
2. What is Laplacian smoothing? Does Laplacian smoothing eventually shrink a closed
curve/surface to a single point and why?
3. How are differential coordinates computed and how do differential coordinates
approximate local shape (e.g. what do the direction and magnitude approximate)?
4. Explain the method of voxel carving to construct a 3D model given multiple images.
Is it necessary to know where the cameras are located in 3D space?
5. How does range scanning work, and why is it helpful when creating geometric
meshes?
6. What are marching cubes and how are they used?
7. What are implicit surfaces, and what are (at least) 2 advantages of implicit surfaces
compared to triangle meshes?
8. Describe L-system and give an example of its application.
