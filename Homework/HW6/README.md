# HW 6. Advanced Rendering

The TAs will choose one of the following questions during the grading session. Please
be prepared to give a one-minute answer with your partner.
1. Describe the relationship between the camera frame rate and the rotation speed of
a four-spoked wagon wheel which would cause a temporal aliasing effect of the
wheel appearing to rotate slowly backwards.
2. Why should one pre-filter out high frequencies before sampling during ray tracing?
3. How does the box filter remove high frequency details of an image?
4. What is supersampling?
5. Describe the circle of confusion and depth of field. Why does a pinhole camera
have infinite depth of field?
6. Explain why sunsets are red.
7. What is in-scattering and why is it used?
8. How can we implement volumetric emission, and what is an example of a real-life
volumetric emissive light source?
