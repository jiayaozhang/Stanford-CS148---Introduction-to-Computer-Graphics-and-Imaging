Quiz Question 
The TAs will choose one of the following questions during the grading session. Please
be prepared to give a one-minute answer with your partner.

1. How do we interpolate a quantity at a point inside of a triangle given the quantities
at each of the three vertices? Hint: for instance, suppose we have different color
values at each triangle vertex; how then should we weigh the colors at each of
these vertices to interpolate the color at e.g. the center of the triangle?

2. What’s the difference between radiant intensity, irradiance, and radiance?

3. What is the difference between BRDF, BTDF, and BSSRDF models? Give a visual
description of each.

4. Discuss the difference between Gouraud shading and Phong shading, and explain
why Phong shading can render more realistic results than Gouraud shading.

5. What is smooth shading? Why does it look “smoother” than flat shading?

6. How do shading techniques change when you shade corners?

7. What is ambient lighting and how is ambient color computed?

8. Describe the difference between point light and area light. Give real-world examples
of each.
