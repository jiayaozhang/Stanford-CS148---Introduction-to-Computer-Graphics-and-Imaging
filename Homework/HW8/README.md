# HW 8. Texture Mapping

Quiz Question (1 pt)
The TAs will choose one of the following questions during the grading session. Please
be prepared to give a one-minute answer with your partner.
1. How do we assign colors to triangle mesh by a uv coordinate and a texture?
2. Suppose you are not sure whether your mesh is UV mapped correctly for your
texture. How might you go about debugging? Justify your answer.
3. Why does interpolating in screen space result in texture distortion?
4. Whatâ€™s the difference between MIP maps and RIP maps?
5. What are the pros and cons of using bump / normal maps vs. displacement maps?
6. What does a normal map store and how does it store that information? How is it
different from a bump map?
7. Why do we use texture tiling?
8. What are the algorithmic steps for generating Perlin noise? Why is using Perlin
noise advantageous?
